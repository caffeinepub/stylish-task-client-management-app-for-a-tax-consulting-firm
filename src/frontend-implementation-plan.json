Enhance metrics cards with subtle shadows (shadow-sm), borders (border border-border), and refined background colors. Add clear typography hierarchy using font-semibold/font-bold for headings, increased text sizes for key metrics (text-3xl/text-4xl), and muted colors for labels. Apply card shadows and borders to revenue aggregation tables and task breakdown sections. Use accent colors from the existing palette (sage green primary, warm neutrals) for visual highlights. Ensure all existing functionality (drill-down navigation via handleNavigation callbacks, data aggregations, clickable table rows) remains intact. Maintain responsive grid layouts and mobile behavior."
