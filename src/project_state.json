    "Dashboard should support interactive drill-down: clicking an aggregate metric navigates/filters to the corresponding Tasks list view (e.g., by category/status) and shows the matching items.",
    "Task.status should be constrained to the allowed set: Pending, Docs Pending, In Progress, Checking, Payment Pending, Completed, Hold; UI and dashboard aggregations should treat these as the canonical statuses.",
    "Single Add Task form should not depend on dropdown/select components for Client Name or Assigned Name; treat them as optional free-text fields.",
