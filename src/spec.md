# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix backend canister connection issues and ensure successful deployment with working authentication and data operations.

**Planned changes:**
- Investigate and resolve the backend canister connection error from Version 48
- Verify frontend-to-backend actor connection after deployment
- Test all authentication flows including Internet Identity sign-in and profile setup
- Ensure all CRUD operations for clients, tasks, assignees, and todos remain functional

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully access the application, sign in with Internet Identity, and perform all task management operations without connection errors.
