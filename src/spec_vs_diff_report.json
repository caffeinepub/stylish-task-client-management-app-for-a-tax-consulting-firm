  "summary": "TaskFormDialog.tsx was updated to use a non-empty sentinel value for an unset Status Select (addressing the Radix empty-string crash) and appears to move Client/Assignee to free-text fields per the diff summary. However, the provided truncated diff does not show the JSX where required markers/HTML required validation would be removed, so REQ-42 cannot be fully verified from the available evidence.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-42",
      "requirement": "Make all fields optional in the single Task create flow UI (including Client Name, Task Category, and Sub Category) by removing required markers and HTML required validation, while keeping the existing backend API calls functional.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet does not include the JSX for the inputs/labels (where required asterisks and `required` attributes would be present/removed), so it’s not verifiable from the truncated content that required markers/HTML validation were removed and that blank submits produce a clear inline/user-visible error on backend rejection.",
