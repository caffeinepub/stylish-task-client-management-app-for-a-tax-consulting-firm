  "summary": "Diff implements the new Client field shape across backend types and frontend UI, adds a Motoko migration mapping legacy client.contactInfo into notes, adds frontend bulk upload (CSV) utilities + dialog, and adds React Query hooks for bulk create/delete. However, the diff summary does not provide direct evidence that backend CRUD read/update functions and the new bulk client APIs are actually implemented/exposed in backend/main.mo (only the new Client type and createClient are shown before truncation).",
