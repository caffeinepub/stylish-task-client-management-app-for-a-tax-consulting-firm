      "id": "REQ-118",
      "requirement": "Test the production build locally using a production-like server configuration to reproduce the loading failure, verify JavaScript module serving with correct MIME types, and ensure the application initializes correctly before deploying to production.",
      "reason": "No evidence of test scripts, documentation, or configuration for local production testing environment. While frontend/.ic-assets.json5 configures MIME types for production, there are no test scripts or procedures visible in the diff to verify the production build locally before deployment.",
