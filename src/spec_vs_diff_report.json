  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements: logo replacement (REQ-77), React Query cache optimization (REQ-78/79), and loading indicators (REQ-80). Logo files are replaced in AppLayout and SignedOutScreen. All three mutation hook files (tasks.ts, clients.ts, assignees.ts) add optimistic updates with onMutate/onError/onSettled callbacks and targeted invalidation. All three form dialogs add isPending checks, disabled inputs, loading button text, and prevented closure during mutations.",
