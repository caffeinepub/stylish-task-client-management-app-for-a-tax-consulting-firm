  "summary": "The diff implements a fix for JavaScript module loading errors by adding an IC assets configuration file (.ic-assets.json5) that explicitly sets Content-Type headers for JavaScript files to 'application/javascript'. The implementation directly addresses REQ-106 by configuring proper MIME type headers for .js files. However, the diff does not provide evidence of changes to verify or modify the Vite build configuration or index.html (REQ-105), and there's no direct evidence showing the fix was tested against the acceptance criteria for REQ-104.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-105",
      "requirement": "Verify that the frontend build configuration (vite.config.ts or similar) correctly outputs ES modules and that the index.html script tag includes type=\"module\" attribute for the main entry point.",
      "reason": "No changes to vite.config.ts or index.html are shown in the diff. The requirement explicitly asks to verify and ensure the build configuration and index.html have the correct module settings, but the diff only shows the addition of .ic-assets.json5 for server-side headers.",

    {
      "description": "Added comprehensive asset configuration including CSS, images (png, jpg, jpeg, svg), fonts (woff, woff2), and security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to fix JavaScript module loading errors and ensure correct Content-Type headers for JavaScript files. Adding configurations for CSS, images, fonts, and security headers was not requested and goes beyond the scope of fixing the JavaScript module loading issue.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Added urlParams.ts utility functions for URL parameter management",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest makes no mention of needing URL parameter utilities or session storage management. This appears to be unrelated functionality added alongside the module loading fix.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Modified backend/main.mo with various type definitions and data structures",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states in constraints to 'Maintain single-actor backend architecture in backend/main.mo' and the requirements are focused on frontend module loading issues. Backend modifications were not requested and contradict the constraint to not modify the backend beyond what's needed.",
