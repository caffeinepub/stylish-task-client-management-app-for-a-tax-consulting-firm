  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements (REQ-92 through REQ-96) for optimizing bulk update performance. Frontend changes include optimistic updates in useBulkUpdateTasks, loading states in TaskBulkEditDialog, precise cache invalidation, and success toast notifications. Backend changes optimize bulkUpdateTasks with improved data processing. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",

      "description": "Added backend/migration.mo file implementing data migration infrastructure with OldActor/NewActor types and migration.run function",
