  "summary": "REQ-52 is partially implemented: taskSort.ts adds an assignee sort field and sorting case, but the null/empty-string behavior for assignedName and the TasksPage UI wiring cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff. There are also unrequested metadata/documentation updates.",

      "id": "REQ-52",
      "requirement": "sortTasks() can sort by assignedName using the existing null-safe, case-insensitive string comparison behavior, with tasks with missing/empty assignedName sorting to the end.",
      "reason": "The implemented compareValues() only pushes null/undefined to the end; empty strings (\"\") are treated as valid values and would sort before non-empty names, violating the 'missing/empty sorts to the end' requirement unless empty values are represented as null/undefined upstream (not shown).",

      "requirement": "In TasksPage.tsx, the \"Sort by\" Select includes an option for the new assignee sort field, and selecting it updates the rendered task ordering accordingly.",
      "reason": "TasksPage.tsx is truncated before the sorting Select rendering and before any sortTasks() invocation/wiring is shown, so the presence of the new SelectItem option and the state-to-sorting behavior cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",
