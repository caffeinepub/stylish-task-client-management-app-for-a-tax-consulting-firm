REQ-1 and REQ-2 are fully addressed with extensive console logging, query state tracking, and error handling in TasksPage.tsx and task hooks. REQ-3 is addressed with public task query hooks and backend endpoint availability. However, no explicit evidence of error boundary implementation or health check queries is found in the truncated diff.",
