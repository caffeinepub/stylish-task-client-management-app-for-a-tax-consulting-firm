  "summary": "REQ-63 is largely implemented by introducing a safe coercion helper for task status values and using it in TaskFormDialog edit-mode initialization, plus converting the sentinel selection to `null` on submit so Radix Select is never controlled with an empty string. However, due to truncation, the diff does not conclusively show that no SelectItem uses `value=\"\"` and that the Select never receives `\"\"` in all Task edit flow codepaths.",

      "requirement": "No SelectItem in the Task edit flow uses value=\"\" and no Select component in the Task edit flow receives \"\" as its controlled value.",
      "reason": "TaskFormDialog.tsx is truncated before the SelectContent/SelectItem list, so it cannot be verified from the provided diff summary whether any SelectItem uses value=\"\" or whether any other codepath passes \"\" into the Select value.",
