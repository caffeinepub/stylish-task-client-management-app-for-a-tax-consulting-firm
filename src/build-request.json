      "id": "REQ-52",
      "text": "Extend the Tasks page sorting controls and sorting logic to support assignee-wise sorting (i.e., sort by Task.assignedName) in addition to the existing sort fields (including the already-supported client-wise sorting).",
      "target": "frontend",

        "messageIds": [

      },
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "In frontend/src/utils/taskSort.ts, the SortField union includes an assignee sort field (e.g., \"assignedName\") and SORT_FIELD_LABELS includes an English label for it.",
        "In frontend/src/utils/taskSort.ts, sortTasks() can sort by assignedName using the existing null-safe, case-insensitive string comparison behavior (tasks with missing/empty assignedName sort to the end).",
        "In frontend/src/pages/TasksPage.tsx, the \"Sort by\" Select includes an option for the new assignee sort field, and selecting it updates the rendered task ordering accordingly.",
        "Existing sort options (Due Date, Status, Task Category, Client Name, Bill Amount, Created At) continue to work as before."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify any files under frontend/src/components/ui (read-only shadcn components).",
    "Do not introduce backend schema/API changes for this request; sorting must remain client-side on the Tasks page."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Adding new filters or grouping views (e.g., grouped-by-client or grouped-by-assignee sections).",
    "Changing the meaning of the existing \"Client Name\" sorting behavior."
